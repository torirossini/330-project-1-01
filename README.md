## Requirements
- DOM controls used: Sliders, Dropdowns, and Buttons
- Text Content: Title, h1, instructions in an unordered list
- Functional and without errors
- Mouse functionality in allowing the user to place botany stamps wherever they want withthe settings chosen

## Above and Beyond
- I thought the use of my Botany class was pretty cool, and I like  the CSS and how nicely that all works together. 

## Resources Used:
- Slider Documentation: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp
- CSS transitions: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_transition_hover.asp
- Color Palette Assistance (I love this site, so many options): https://coolors.co/

## Self Grade
- I hope it's a solid 90, I didn't do much above and beyond in terms of functionality but the functions that are there are polished and fun to play with. You could make some pretty cool pieces and export it with ease.
